// Inheritance
/*

Inheritance is the process by which one class acquires the properties (methods and fields) of another. 
With the use of inheritance the information is made manageable in a hierarchical order.

The class which inherits the properties of other is known as subclass (derived class, child class) 
and the class whose properties are inherited is known as superclass (base class, parent class).

Types of Inheritance:
1. Single Inheritance
2. Multiple Inheritance
3. Multilevel Inheritance
4. Hierarchical Inheritance
5. Hybrid Inheritance
